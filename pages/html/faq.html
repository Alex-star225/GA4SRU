<p><b>A:</b> You know that too many assets have been loaded on this original file <i>go full.swf</i>.

<p><b>Q:</b> How did you got anyone join the GoAnimate Remastered for that?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> I used port forwarding to make people anyone can join it. So prefer node.js allows me to everyone join for any real person.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Uh oh! I got banned from bonzi.world! It says "Error 1006"</p>
<p><b>A:</b> That owner has been banned your IP address? Let me help you, so you can't revive this website right now, this ban is a permanent, you can't do this right now, just sit there and relax when ban is completed and dead. It's now protected and faster within Cloudflare security. You will need to use CloudFail to get a real IP address and BagelChip knows they are pirating and giving phishing malware on the computer.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Oh my god! I got banned from Fastest Edition!</p>
<p><b>A:</b> You know that rules is likely against for the lawsuit, you know that rules could ban you permanently by an owner? You are banned, but you can still explore the site by clicking that little button over there when message shows up on this screen.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Oh no! I got banned from BonziWORLD: Revived!</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Oh not good. Kiddie detected but Diogo the Object Thingy 2020 does, you get tons of dislikes on you tube, you can't do that like a BagelChip! They're agreeing for flawless people, but you cannot respect their opinions right now because of toxicity and can't be sued, likely copyright owners can't. Further way, you have to kill yourselves and your parents. In 3, 2, 1, stop!!! If you kill your parents, you could cause lot of cash! So, you can create a new project and stop visiting their sites like BonziWORLD Revived otherwise they've to dox your entire information for that and you need to buy the new router after the dox, get a new IP, unblocked and unbanned, growtopia ready. Get documentating out, like HTML in fire! Make your site popular next time!</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why I recieved a message "Connection timed out" help?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> ENONET and ETIMEOUT are error messages there are no internet has been not recieved this request. This caused by major issue for slow users. But don't worry, a server will reboot about minute.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why you move the dropdowns on this site?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Because there's no space to place on right here, if you wonder this. Get a bigger resolution than your favorite TV!</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why download and upload speed is slow for you?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Hereby download and upload speeds cannot be upgraded by ISP, so you need get a new modem we recommend you to buy D-Link router on your older home. Send a zip code, to deliver your own device online!</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why you keep doing that like a 10 hours of time?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Because of this associated time zone Vilnius, we will sleep when the date & time goes out into night. On USA, they're fore days!!!</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Is Cloudflare bad for you?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Cloudflare does not make a bad, it prevents DDoS attacks from your front new website. See in Google "<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=under%20attack%20cloudflare" target="_blank">Under attack?</a>".</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> Why Vyond is fucking dead site?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Because for the Vyond Studio includes fortnight (2 weeks = 14 days) day trial, expires and you have to do it again and again keep creating with temp-mails and free phone numbers. If you little bit dislike Vyond, go to GoAnimate for Schools Remastered. So Vyond can't patch it in real life. So if chances are very rare, results in a ban with Cloudflare, and you will get sued for bringing it back G4SR.</p>
<p><b>Q:</b> It is site G4SR unattackable IP?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Yes, it's unattackable providers by Telia Lietuva AB, so this provider prevents massive large DDoS attacks we can't get it attacked (only an leak could cause the internet problems).</p>
